This Python program serves as a simple music tracking system designed to organize and analyse user preferences for songs and artists. It provides functionalities to add songs, track their popularity, and manage user likes and dislikes. The system operates by maintaining three text files: one for storing song information, another for liked songs, and a third for disliked songs.
The key features include:
1.	Adding Songs: Users can input the name of a song and its artist to build a growing list of entries.
2.	Tracking Popularity: By analysing the song file, the program identifies the most frequently added songs and artists, offering insights into trends and preferences.
3.	Like/Dislike Management: Users can express their preference by liking or disliking songs, with the ability to review these lists later.
4.	Viewing Favourites: Separate functionalities allow users to display lists of liked and disliked songs for easy reference.
The program ensures ease of use with an intuitive menu-driven interface, offering options to perform all operations interactively. By initializing and managing text-based storage, it ensures data persistence across sessions. This code is particularly useful for individuals looking to manage their personal music preferences or gain insights into song popularity trends based on user entries. It can be further extended to incorporate advanced analytics or user-specific customization.
